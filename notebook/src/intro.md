Intro
===

These are a collection of useful personal notes about various technical work
that I have experienced or done and may be useful for others.

Over time information in these notes _will become outdated_. The point is not to
keep an updated set of technical notes but to have snapshots of how things _could_
actually be done (though if I do learn updated methods, I will update the notes)

Plenty of other interesting information is available in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/enckse/dotfiles)
