Alpine Boot
===

## EFI

Using EFI in Alpine is supported but the documentation is not consistently available
in the wiki where one would expect.

### environment

Setup the necessary environment variables

```
export BOOTLOADER=grub
export USE_EFI=1
```

### packages

Drop `syslinux` and add grub/friends

```
apk del syslinux
apk add grub grub-efi efibootmgr
```

## Boot Arguments

Information that expands upon the documentation for Alpine's initramfs command
line options.

### ssh_key

- installs `openssh`
- enables/starts `sshd`
- takes the _string literal_ from `ssh_key` and puts that value into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### apkovl

APK overlay file to download and apply onto the system (this is a URL). Placing the
file using the `device:fstype:path` method does not appear to work.

_These are generally considered "Alpine local backups" and managed via `lbu`
if seeking more information._

### alpine_repo

URL to use as the repository in the system

### ip

In order to get an IP one can use `=dhcp` OR define everything important
to get a network connection during init:

```
172.16.0.200:none:172.16.0.1:255.255.255.0:myhostname::none:1.1.1.1
^ ip address to request
             ^ server ip
                  ^ gateway
                             ^ netmask
                                           ^ system hostname
                                                      ^ autoconf is N/A
                                                            ^ DNS
```
